## My process
At first I structured all the content in HTML-file keeping in mind how I will styling it in CSS. After that I added general styles in CSS such as `font-family`, `font-size` and `background-color`. When general things were done I started adding custom CSS properties for the content to look as much as possible as in an example.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Interesting part for me was adjusting content (image and tex)  inside the container. 

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
